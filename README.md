**IMPORTANT NOTICE: since MIPS loongson3a servers are not available for me nowadays, I'm unable to make any actual releases.**

----

A certain period of time, do some works about transplanting some applications to [MIPS loongson3a Server](http://www.loongnix.org/index.php). 

So, project will provide some prebuilt binary in python for MIPS or scripts and notes for cross compiling for MIPS . Mostly tested based on loongson3a machine or container inside.

If you find bugs or other questions, email me or fill a issue with standard form.
